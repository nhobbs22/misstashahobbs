                   as well as a minor musical theater at Santa Clara University back in 2012. I also received my Masters
                    in Teaching at Santa Clara in 2022. Go Broncos! When I'm not at school, I spend most of my free time 
                    exploring in the forest or going to the beach or the river. I also love painting, singing karaoke, and 
                    spending time with my wonderful family and friends. My previous professional backgrounds include: 
                    makeup artist, UX/UI designer, and graphic designer. </h3>

                “There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; 
                that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion; [...] The power
                 which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know 
                 until he has tried.” - Ralph Waldo Emerson

                  educator to help find what makes a child sparkle and encourage that child to shine to their brightest potential.
                   No two students work the same way and what motivates each individual is very different. I want to create a 
                   classroom experience tailored to help students’ individualities and differences shine. This can be accomplished 
                   by creating a supportive and inclusive community in my classroom where students feel safe to express their ideas. </h3>

            <h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am devoted to teaching because of my overall love and faith in humanity. It is my goal to create 
                compassionate, virtuous learners who see the benefits of helping the greater good. I want to foster competent
                 members of society that can challenge the norms and can contribute to its growth. This can be accomplished by
                  allowing students the opportunity to be diverse learners and by emphasizing the importance of building a 
                  supportive community in the classroom. I strive to create an environment where students are not limited to 
                  “imitation” but are encouraged to find their own voice. I seek to understand what drives each child’s mind and
                   inspires him or her. I am excited to learn about what unique brilliance my students have to offer by giving them 
                   the confidence to believe in themselves and the tools to learn how to think, question, and grow in our inclusive
                classroom environment. Through building a symbiotic community, we can teach empathy, affirmations, and 
                self-reliance to children.

            <h3>It is important to provide children with both the academic and emotional skills needed to navigate this world.
                 It is so crucial that such skills be fostered so that the next generations value both themselves and each other
                 thus be well placed to take on the challenge of stewarding human existence. I have faith that all children are 
                 capable of greatness. Every human deserves a chance to be the best version of themselves and I am committed to 
                 provide children with the means to reach their true potential.
