              <h3 class="bigger bold">My name is Natasha Hobbs. I am from the Bay Area, California! I received my Bachelors in Studio Art
                as well as a minor musical theater at Santa Clara University back in 2012. I also received my Masters
                 in Teaching at Santa Clara in 2022. Go Broncos!  When I'm not at school, I enjoy hiking, going to the beach, or visiting the river. 
                 I also love painting, singing karaoke, and spending time with my wonderful family and friends. 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 My previous professional backgrounds include: 
                 makeup artist, UX/UI designer, and graphic designer. While I learned alot from my previous careers, I am so excited for this opportunity 
             to teach. I believe that all children are capable of greatness and I am committed to 
             provide them with the means to reach their true potential. </h3>

              <h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each and every one of us have our own bit of magic, and I believe that is my responsibility as a future 
                  educator to help find what makes a child sparkle and encourage that child to shine to their brightest potential.
                   No two students work the same way and what motivates each individual is very different. I want to create a 
                   classroom experience tailored to help students’ individualities and differences shine. This can be accomplished 
                   by creating a supportive and inclusive community in my classroom where students feel safe to express their ideas. </h3>

           <!-- <h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am devoted to teaching because of my overall love and faith in humanity. It is my goal to create 
                compassionate, virtuous learners who see the benefits of helping the greater good. I want to foster competent
                 members of society that can challenge the norms and can contribute to its growth. This can be accomplished by
                  allowing students the opportunity to be diverse learners and by emphasizing the importance of building a 
                  supportive community in the classroom. I strive to create an environment where students are not limited to 
                  “imitation” but are encouraged to find their own voice. I seek to understand what drives each child’s mind and
                   inspires him or her. I am excited to learn about what unique brilliance my students have to offer by giving them 
                   the confidence to believe in themselves and the tools to learn how to think, question, and grow in our inclusive
                classroom environment. Through building a symbiotic community, we can teach empathy, affirmations, and 
                self-reliance to children.

            <h3>It is important to provide children with both the academic and emotional skills needed to navigate this world.
                 It is so crucial that such skills be fostered so that the next generations value both themselves and each other
                 thus be well placed to take on the challenge of stewarding human existence. I have faith that all children are 
                 capable of greatness. Every human deserves a chance to be the best version of themselves and I am committed to 
                 provide children with the means to reach their true potential.
